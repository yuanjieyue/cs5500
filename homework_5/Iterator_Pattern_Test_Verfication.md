## Iterator Pattern Test Verification

I cover the program with both function testing and structural testing.
- functional testing 
The six method in the interface all work well. 
For the input 0, 1, 5, 32 and 31 * 32 + 31;

- structrual testing
All the tests cover the boudray cases of the input and normal input, most branches are covered.

So the test should be sufficient.
