## for the Observer Pattern

I cover the program with both functional testing and structural testing.

- function testing
Both of the Subject's three method and the Observer's update method work well.
For the subjects who have state as a normal string, empty string and given string as null.

- structural testing
All the other tests covers the boundary case of the input and normal input, they are all working well.
Make sure most of the branches have been covered.

So the test above should be sufficient.
